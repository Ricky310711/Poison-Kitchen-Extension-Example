# EXAMPLE EXTENSION
## A fake poison kitchen extension for people to create extensions.

This is a simple example as to how to create an extension.
My own scripting language has been made for full GUI implementation and as we know, C# is much faster then a typical shell.

The tool looks for the file "extension.info".
In the extension.info file you will specify the extension name, description and the poison shell script file(.psh).

For syntax examples check the FakeOpt.psh file in this repo.
